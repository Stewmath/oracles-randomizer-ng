# Seasons Hard Logic Strategy Guide

This document details tricks and obscurities that are in Seasons hard logic.
See
[seasons_notes.md](https://github.com/jangler/oracles-randomizer/blob/doc/seasons_notes.md)
for a list of things that are out of logic even in hard.

## General

- Use mystery seeds to light torches (1 in 4 chance of success). This is only
  in logic for rooms with no more than 2 torches.
- Get various types of seeds from sources other than trees:
	- Pegasus seeds from Subrosia Market (requires shield)
	- Ember seeds from the plants in Agunima's room in D4
	- Ember seeds from the Armos puzzle chest in D5
	- Ember seeds from the plants in the first Poe Sister's room in D7
	- Mystery seeds from Frypolar's room in D8
- Get bombs from the plants in D2.
- Use bomb boosts to increase jump distance. Pull a bomb near the gap you're
  jumping, move slightly closer to the gap, and jump in the desired direction
  as the bomb explodes. Buffering the simultaneous jump + directional input by
  holding the relevant buttons while closing a menu makes the trick easier.

  Strictly horizontal and vertical bomb jumps include:
	- Lava between Mt. Cucco portal and Subrosia Market
	- Water between D5 entrance and minecart room
	- Lava before cave entrance in Temple Remains
	- Water in Sunken City diving cave
	- Water in cave under Floodgate Keeper's House
	- Lava in Goron Mountain cave
	- Water in Goron Mountain cave
	- Lava between north & south Subrosia
	- Lava in Subrosia on Temple Remains portal screen

  Specific multi-directional bomb jumps are detailed later in this document,
  with video examples.

### Cross-game items: general uses

- Cane of Somaria can be used to push hardhat beetles into holes (ie.
  map chest room in D2).
- Cane of Somaria can be used to kill water tektites by creating the
  block by the edge of the water, then pushing it into the water (ie. in D4).

## Overworld

- RNG manip 100-rupee drops using the shovel, for infinite rupees in logic.
  Hard reset, mash through the title screen (it rolls RNG every frame), make 7
  screen transitions, and dig until the 100-rupee drop. Make sure not to delay
  the dig after the Rope, since the Rope also rolls RNG periodically.

- Cucco clip: reach the cave below the Spring Banana tree by grabbing the Cucco
  through the corner – move straight right into the rock before the screen
  transition so that the rock pushes you downward. This only matters if you
  have gale seeds to warp out.

- Cornerwalk across the gaps in the house on the Western Coast in order to
  reach the stump. In the second room, only move diagonally for a moment, then
  hold right. To get back, reenter and walk straight up.

  cape. [[Video]](https://imgur.com/SXQvM8b)

- D3: Use the long hook (or switch hook + pegasus seeds) to reach the miniboss
  without the feather. It is quite precise when using switch hook + pegasus
  seeds. (TODO: video)
- D4: Hit minecart levers by dropping pots while passing by. This works for both
  1F minecarts.

- D5: Pegasus + feather jump to reach the left chest (no bomb boost required).

- D5: Jump through the "wall" of fire traps.

- D5: Use the long hook to reach some pots off-screen and access a chest. (TODO:
  video)
- D6: Corner-walk around the first crystal, or just run through the blade traps,
  obviating feather or a means to break the crystal.
- D6: Can use the Cane of Somaria through a wall in multiple rooms in D6. (TODO:
  video)
- D7: Poe skip: skip fighting the first Poe.

- D7: Hit the three buttons in the correct order without pegasus seeds, by
  jumping on the edges of the tiles.

- D8: Hit the first eye statue with seeds + feather + satchel.
  [[Video]](https://imgur.com/yJnKZ18)
- D8: Hit sets of three eye statues with feather + satchel/slingshot instead of
  HSS. Only ember and scent seeds are in logic with the slingshot.

- D8: Activate the bridge switch without L-2 boomerang or seeds + cape.

## Not in logic but still cool

- D6: Seed Shooter can be used to hit the orbs on the path to Vire, without the
  magic boomerang. This requires using pegasus seeds to wall-clip into
  a specific pixel, and furthermore, may be subpixel dependent. (TODO: video)
